		<h2>Mister Crab</h2>

		<p>A crab is a water-dwelling creature, a decapod crustacean of the infraorder Brachyura. Crab meat is the meat found within a crab. It is used in many cuisines across the world, prized for its soft, delicate, sweet taste. Crabs are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, composed primarily of highly mineralized chitin, and armed with a single pair of chelae. Crabs are found in all of the world's oceans, while many crabs live in fresh water and on land, particularly in tropical regions. Crabs vary in size from the pea crab, a few millimetres wide, to the Japanese spider crab, with a leg span of up to 4 metres </p>
